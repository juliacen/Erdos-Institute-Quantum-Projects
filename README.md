In this notebook, we will construct a multi-controlled U $\in$ U(2) gate that is composed of only 1-qubit gates and $CX$ gates. The definition of a multi-controlled U gate is as follows



meaning that the U gate only acts on our target qubit, $1$, only if all $n$ of our control qubits are in the $1$ state and we do nothing otheriwse. The construction presented below follows the decomposition presented in Chapter 4 of the Nielson and Chaung textbook.
