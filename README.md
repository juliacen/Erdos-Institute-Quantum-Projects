# Multi-controlled Unitary Gate Decomposition

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores multiple strategies for decomposing **multi-controlled unitary (MCU)** quantum gates into basic 1- and 2-qubit gates. The study includes both theoretical decompositions based on seminal quantum computing literature and practical implementations using Qiskit's built-in features.

## Overview

Multi-controlled unitary gates are an essential component in quantum algorithms like Groverâ€™s search and quantum arithmetic circuits. However, directly implementing these gates on real hardware requires decomposing them into native quantum gates (such as CNOT and single-qubit rotations).

This notebook:

- Explains how to decompose MCU gates using various methods
- Implements and compares decompositions manually and with Qiskit
- Analyzes resource requirements (e.g., number of CX gates)
- Benchmarks the performance of different decomposition strategies

## Contents

### 1. Finding Phase and Euler Angles
Extracts the necessary parameters to express any single-qubit unitary \( U \) in terms of its ZYZ Euler decomposition.

### 2. Implementing MCU Gates in Qiskit
Uses Qiskit's built-in functionality to implement controlled unitary operations for small-scale demonstrations.

### 3. Nielsen & Chuang Figure 4.10
Reproduces and explains the decomposition circuit for a controlled- \( U \) operation based on Figure 4.10 in the standard quantum computing textbook.

### 4. Decomposing CCX and CU Gates
Builds decompositions for Toffoli (CCX) and controlled-unitary (CU) gates using only CNOTs and 1-qubit rotations.

### 5. MCU Decomposition with Basic Gates
Presents a general approach to decompose any MCU gate into a sequence of CNOT and 1-qubit operations. Also compares implementations with and without ancilla qubits.

### 6. Benchmarking
Measures circuit depth and gate count across decomposition methods to evaluate scalability and hardware feasibility.

### 7. Complexity Analysis
Summarizes the gate complexity of different decomposition techniques with respect to the number of control qubits.

### 8. Alternative Methods
Mentions newer or specialized decomposition techniques (e.g., linear-depth methods) from recent literature.
